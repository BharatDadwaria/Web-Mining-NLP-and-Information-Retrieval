# Web-Mining-NLP-and-Information-Retrieval
Mining the Web and playing with Natural Language processing. Implementing the Information retrieval System tasks. Going towards the NLP and Performing Machine Learning algorithms. Through these codes and problems i have understand the information retrieval process of any search engine.

## Content
I have implemented all the code in python. Through out this repository i have tried to solve some Web mining, Information Retrieval problems and Natural Language Processing problems. These problem are very common and very important problems when we talk about the Data Science, Machine leanrning or data mining. Through out this repository i have learn and implemented the major issues and problems of Search engines that is How to rank the Documents or websites by their query.
